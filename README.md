# Regulatory variants associated with COPD

<div style = "text-align: justify">
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a lung condition characterized by breathing difficulties. Previously it was studied the gene expression profiles of this disease and published in PulmonDB database. But it was unknown which variants cause the disease, which is the main objective, where I found the variants that change the expression of the previously analyzed genes.        

To do that, I focused on retrieving the variants previously annotated for COPD genes and the disease, then analyzing them with Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (RSAT) to retrieve transcriptional factor motifs where the variants are affecting. Then I searched for genes close to the variants and filtered for those in a meta-analysis (realized by Ana Beatriz Villase√±or), which complemented the data from PulmonDB.
